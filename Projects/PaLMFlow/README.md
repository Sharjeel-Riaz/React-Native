# PaLMFlow

PaLMFlow is an innovative project developed using [React
Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and powered by
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). This project combines the capabilities of
generative AI provided by Google's [PaLM 2.0](https://developers.generativeai.google/products/palm) with the ease of building your own RESTful
API using Next.js.
